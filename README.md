Image was based on https://ko-fi.com/s/2bc1d9591f

## How to use

* Make a new browser source
* Set dimensions to 1920 x 1080
* Set url to be `https://swolekat.github.io/ds-overlay`
* Use your controller and enjoy :)

## remapping buttons
If you need to remap buttons you can use query parameters. You'll need to find the button ID and possibly subtract 1 (if button 0 doesn't exist, subtract 1).

For example, if you want to swap B and A use `https://swolekat.github.io/ds-overlay?a=0&b=1`

## limitations
* Only works with xbox controller
* Can't change the ds skin
